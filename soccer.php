            <h1>Soccer </h1>

            <p> Football is a family of team sports that involve, to varying degrees, kicking a ball to score a goal.
                Unqualified, the word football normally means the form of football that is the most popular where the
                word
                is used. Sports commonly called football include association football (known as soccer in some
                countries);
                gridiron football (specifically American football or Canadian football); Australian rules football;
                rugby
                football (either rugby union or rugby league); and Gaelic football. These various forms of football
                share to
                varying extent common origins and are known as football codes.</p>

            <h2>History </h2>
            <p>
                Kicking ball games arose independently multiple times across multiple cultures. According to FIFA, the
                Chinese competitive game cuju (蹴鞠, literally "kick ball") is the earliest form of football for which
                there
                is evidence. Cuju players could use any part of the body apart from hands and the intent was kicking a
                ball
                through an opening into a net. It was remarkably similar to modern football, though similarities to
                rugby
                occurred. During the Han Dynasty (206 BCE – 220 CE), cuju games were standardised and rules were
                established

            <h2>Name</h2>
            <p>Football is one of a family of football codes, which emerged from various ball games played worldwide
                since antiquity. The modern game traces its origins to 1863 when the Laws of the Game were originally
                codified in England by The Football Association (FA). The name association football was coined to
                distinguish the game from the other forms of football played at the time, specifically rugby football.
                The first written "reference to the inflated ball used in the game" was in the mid-14th century: "Þe
                heued fro þe body went, Als it were a foteballe." The Online Etymology Dictionary states that the "rules
                of the game" were made in 1848, before the "split off in 1863".</p>
            <h2>Laws</h2>
            <p>There are 17 laws in the official Laws of the Game, each containing a collection of stipulation and
                guidelines. The same laws are designed to apply to all levels of football, although certain
                modifications for groups such as juniors, seniors, women and people with physical disabilities are
                permitted.</p>

                aren’t made with your mind, but with your instinct.,A lion doesn’t concern himself with the opinions of
                the sheep.You can overcome anything, if and only if you love something enough.Money is not a motivating
                factor…My motivation comes from playing the game I love. If I wasn’t paid to be a professional
                footballer, I would willingly play for nothing.”</p>

                if we had beaten a country, more than just a football team.,To see the ball to run atfer it makes me the
                happiest man in the world, when people succeed it is because of hard work luck has nothing to do with
                success, When I wear the national team shirt its stole contacts with my skin makes it stand on en

                I am not a perfectionist, but I like to feel that things are done well. More important than that, I feel
                an endless need to learn, to improve, to evolve, not only to please the coach and the fans, but also to
                feel satisfied with myself. It is my conviction that here are no limits to learning, and that it can
                never stop, no matter what our age,
                To Be The Best You Need The Best,
                Your love makes me strong, your hate makes me unstoppable,
                I see football as an art and all players are artists.
                If you are a top artist, the last thing you would do is paint a picture somebody else has already
                painted .</p>

                <h3>Pele</h3>
                “ Success is no accident. It is hard work, perseverance, learning, studying, sacrifice and most of all,
                love of what you are doing or learning to do,
                I don't believe there is such a thing as a 'born' soccer player. Perhaps you are born with certain
                skills and talents, but quite frankly it seems impossible to me that one is actually born to be an ace
                soccer player
                The ambition should always be to play an elegant game,
                People argue between Pele or Maradona, Di Stéfano is the best much more complete”.</p>
