            <h2>Gym</h2>
            <p class="firstP">A gymnasium, also known as a gym, is a covered location for athletics. The word is derived
                from the ancient
                Greek gymnasium. They are commonly found in athletic and fitness centres, and as activity and learning
                spaces in educational institutions. " Gym" is also slang for "fitness centre" , which is often an area
                for indoor recreation. A gym may be open air as well. A gym is a place with a number of equipments and
                machines used by the people to do exercises.</p>
            <p>Gymnasia apparatuses such as barbells, jumping board, running path, tennis-balls, cricket field, and
                fencing
                area are used as exercises. In safe weather, outdoor locations are the most conducive to health. Gyms
                were popular in ancient Greece. Their curricula included self-defense, gymnastica medica, or physical
                therapy to help the sick and injured, and for physical fitness and sports, from boxing to dancing to
                skipping rope.</p>

            <h2>History</h2>
            <p>
                The first recorded gymnasiums date back to over 3000 years ago in ancient Persia, where they were known
                as
                zurkhaneh, areas that encouraged physical fitness. The larger Roman Baths often had attached fitness
                facilities, the baths themselves sometimes being decorated with mosaics of local champions of sport.
                Gyms in
                Germany were an outgrowth of the Turnplatz, an outdoor space for gymnastics founded by German educator
                Friedrich Jahn in 1811 and later promoted by the Turners, a nineteenth-century political and gymnastic
                movement. The first American to open a public gym in the United States using Jahn's model was John Neal
                of
                Portland, Maine in 1827. The first indoor gymnasium in Germany was probably the one built in Hesse in
                1852 by Adolph Spiess.
                Through worldwide colonization.</p>
