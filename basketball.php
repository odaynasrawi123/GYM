            <h2>BasketBall</h2>
            <p class="firstP">
                Basketball is a team sport in which two teams, most commonly of five players each, opposing one another on a
                rectangular court, compete with the primary objective of shooting a basketball (approximately 9.4 inches (24
                cm) in diameter) through the defender's hoop (a basket 18 inches (46 cm) in diameter mounted 10 feet (3.048
                m) high to a backboard at each end of the court) while preventing the opposing team from shooting through
                their own hoop.

            <h2>History</h2>
            <p>In December 1891, James Naismith, a Canadian professor of physical education and instructor at the
                International Young Men's Christian Association Training School (now Springfield College) in Springfield,
                Massachusetts, was trying to keep his gym class active on a rainy day. He sought a vigorous indoor game to
                keep his students occupied and at proper levels of fitness during the long New England winters,After
                rejecting other ideas as either too rough or poorly suited to walled-in gymnasiums, he invented a new game
                in which players would pass a ball to teammates and try to score points by tossing the ball into a basket
                mounted on a wall.</p>

            <h2>Rules and regulations</h2>
            <p>Measurements and time limits discussed in this section often vary among tournaments and organizations; international and NBA rules are used in this section. The object of the game is to outscore one's opponents by throwing the ball through the opponents' basket from above while preventing the opponents from doing so on their own. An attempt to score in this way is called a shot. A successful shot is worth two points, or three points if it is taken from beyond the three-point arc 6.75 metres (22 ft 2 in) from the basket in international games[34] and 23 feet 9 inches (7.24 m) in NBA games. A one-point shot can be earned when shooting from the foul line after a foul is made. After a team has scored from a field goal or free throw, play is resumed with a throw-in awarded to the non-scoring team taken from a point beyond the endline of the court where the points(s) were scored.</p>
            <h2>Height</h2>
            <p>At the professional level, most male players are above 6 feet 3 inches (1.91 m) and most women above 5 feet 7 inches (1.70 m). Guards, for whom physical coordination and ball-handling skills are crucial, tend to be the smallest players. Almost all forwards in the top men's pro leagues are 6 feet 6 inches (1.98 m) or taller. Most centers are over 6 feet 10 inches (2.08 m) tall. According to a survey given to all NBA teams,[when?] the average height of all NBA players is just under 6 feet 7 inches (2.01 m), with the average weight being close to 222 pounds (101 kg). The tallest players ever in the NBA were Manute Bol and Gheorghe Mureșan, who were both 7 feet 7 inches (2.31 m) tall. At 7 feet 2 inches (2.18 m), Margo Dydek was the tallest player in the history of the WNBA.</p>
