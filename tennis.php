            <h2>Tennis</h2>
            <p class="firstP">Tennis is a racket sport that can be played individually against a single opponent
                (singles) or between two
                teams of two players each (doubles). Each player uses a tennis racket that is strung with cord to strike
                a
                hollow rubber ball covered with felt over or around a net and into the opponent's court. The object of
                the
                game is to maneuver the ball in such a way that the opponent is not able to play a valid return.</p>

            <p> Tennis is an Olympic sport and is played at all levels of society and at all ages. The sport can be
                played
                by anyone who can hold a racket, including wheelchair users. The modern game of tennis originated in
                Birmingham, England, in the late 19th century as lawn tennis.It had close connections both to various
                field
                (lawn) games such as croquet and bowls as well as to the older racket sport today called real tennis.
                During
                most of the 19th century,</p>
            <img src=" ./images/tennis.jpg" alt="">
            <h2>History</h2>
            <p>
                Historians believe that the game's ancient origin lay in 12th century northern France, where a ball was
                struck with the palm of the hand. Louis X of France was a keen player of jeu de paume ("game of the
                palm"),
                which evolved into real tennis, and became notable as the first person to construct indoor tennis courts
                in
                the modern style. Louis was unhappy with playing tennis outdoors and accordingly had indoor, enclosed
                courts
                made in Paris "around the end of the 13th century". In due course this design spread across royal
                palaces
                all over Europe. In June 1316 at Vincennes, Val-de-Marne and following a particularly exhausting game,
                Louis
                drank a large quantity of cooled wine and subsequently died of either pneumonia or pleurisy, although
                there
                was also suspicion of poisoning. Because of the contemporary accounts of his death, Louis X is history's
                first tennis player known by name. Another of the early enthusiasts of the game was King Charles V of
                France, who had a court set up at the Louvre Palace.

            <h2>Officials</h2>
            <p>In most professional play and some amateur competition, there is an officiating head judge or chair
                umpire (usually referred to simply as the umpire), who sits in a raised chair to one side of the court.
                The umpire has absolute authority to make factual determinations. The umpire may be assisted by line
                judges, who determine whether the ball has landed within the required part of the court and who also
                call foot faults. There also may be a net judge who determines whether the ball has touched the net
                during service. The umpire has the right to overrule a line judge or a net judge if the umpire is sure
                that a clear mistake has been made.</p>
            <h2>Injuries</h2>
            <p>Muscle strain is one of the most common injuries in tennis.[83] When an isolated large-energy appears
                during the muscle contraction and at the same time body weight apply huge amount of pressure to the
                lengthened muscle, muscle strain can occur.[84] Inflammation and bleeding are triggered when muscle
                strain occurs, which can result in redness, pain and swelling.[84] Overuse is also common in tennis
                players of all levels. Muscle, cartilage, nerves, bursae, ligaments and tendons may be damaged from
                overuse. The repetitive use of a particular muscle without time for repair and recovery is the most
                common cause of injury.</p>
